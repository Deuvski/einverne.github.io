`vmstat` 是一个收集和报告系统内存，swap，处理器资源的工具。

> vmstat reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, disks and cpu activity.

## 使用
`vmstat` 的使用非常简单，直接运行

    vmstat
    procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
     r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
     2  0   9496 1632720 1179760 4628968    0    0     9    37   55   12  3  1 96  0  0

输出一大串数据，这一串数据是 vmstat 从开机到运行命令之间记录的平均数据。


    vmstat [delay] [count]

第一行会打印平均值，之后每隔 [delay] 的时间，打印一次报告，在打印 [count] 次之后停止。

输出值解释

    Procs
       r: The number of runnable processes (running or waiting for run time).
       b: The number of processes in uninterruptible sleep.

    Memory
       swpd: the amount of virtual memory used.
       free: the amount of idle memory.
       buff: the amount of memory used as buffers.
       cache: the amount of memory used as cache.
       inact: the amount of inactive memory.  (-a option)
       active: the amount of active memory.  (-a option)

    Swap
       si: Amount of memory swapped in from disk (/s).
       so: Amount of memory swapped to disk (/s).

    IO
       bi: Blocks received from a block device (blocks/s).
       bo: Blocks sent to a block device (blocks/s).

    System
       in: The number of interrupts per second, including the clock.
       cs: The number of context switches per second.

    CPU
       These are percentages of total CPU time.
       us: Time spent running non-kernel code.  (user time, including nice time)
       sy: Time spent running kernel code.  (system time)
       id: Time spent idle.  Prior to Linux 2.5.41, this includes IO-wait time.
       wa: Time spent waiting for IO.  Prior to Linux 2.5.41, included in idle.
       st: Time stolen from a virtual machine.  Prior to Linux 2.6.11, unknown.
